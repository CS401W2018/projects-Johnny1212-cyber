    <p>Yellowstone Ranch is <em>a wide span</em>, beautiful place with mountains, trees, and lots of animals. It’s like a giant playground in nature.I think it would be so fun to see cows, horses, and maybe even some deer or bears. I like the idea of exploring and playing outside all day. </p> <p>What I love most about Yellowstone Ranch is how pretty and peaceful it looks. I’d like to walk on the trails and see the sunset behind the hills. It’s a place where people work hard but also enjoy the outdoors, and that sounds really exciting to me! </p>
