                        Kevin Costner stars as John Dutton in the hit TV series Yellowstone, 
                        a gripping drama about power, land, and family legacy. Dutton is the 
                        patriarch of the largest contiguous ranch in the United States, constantly 
                        battling land developers, Native American reservations, and the government 
                        to protect his family's land.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Costner's portrayal of John Dutton is both intense and emotional, bringing 
                        depth to a character who is ruthless yet deeply protective of his family. 
                        His performance has been widely praised, making him a standout figure in 
                        the modern Western genre.

                        Yellowstone, created by Taylor Sheridan, has become a cultural phenomenon, 
                        with Costner's leadership on-screen being a major reason for its success. 
                        His role in the series further solidifies his legacy as a legendary actor 
                        in Western dramas.
