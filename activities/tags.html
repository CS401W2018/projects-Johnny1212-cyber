    <p>1.Where are the lecture notes?</p>
    <p>ans: lecture notes are in the Cnavas >Home>HTML Basic>Lecture Notes - HTML Basics</p>

    <p>3.What are special entity characters?</p>
    <p>ans: special entity characters are  &entity_name,&#entity_number;&lt; or &#60;; and Non-breaking Space
        A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;
        <br>A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
        <br>
        
        Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.
        <br>
        
        Examples:
        <br>
        
        § 10
        10 km/h
        10 PM
        Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
        <br>
        
        If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.
        <br>
        
        The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new line.
    </p> 
    <p>4.What are phrase tags?</p>
    <p>ans:HTML phrase tags are unique purpose tags designed to use indefinite cases, even though they're implemented in the same manner as other tags are used, which you might have seen in previous chapters. So now, let's dig deep into each of its different types of phrase tags. You might have briefly read about these in the earlier chapters, but not as a subcategory of phrase tags.Like Emphasis Tag, emphasizes or stresses the texts within its opening and closing tags.</p>
    <p>5.What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</p>
    <p>ans:Ol is order list and in default it will show order start from 1 and increase by one .But as I tried up there you can try order list with alphabets and Roman numerical also. <br>
    UL is Unordered List,I already tried it up there</p>
